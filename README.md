# TechCoder 🧠🍎

**TechCoder** is an AI-native consumer health co-pilot that helps users
understand food ingredients at the moment decisions matter.

Instead of listing ingredients, TechCoder reasons about:
- What actually matters
- Why it matters
- Who should care
- Where uncertainty remains

## 🚀 AI-Native Experience
- Intent-first interaction
- No filters, no forms
- AI acts as a co-pilot, not a lookup tool
- Reduces cognitive load at decision time

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- Gemini API (simulated / limited for demo)
